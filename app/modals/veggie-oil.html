      At TREECO, we run 100% vegetable-based oil as a chain lubricant in all of our chainsaws.<br>
      <strong>FACT:</strong> Modern chainsaws still use oil to waste lubricating systems to lubricate and cool the chain and chain bar.

      What this means: All of the oil that is poured into a chainsaw as chain lubricant is introduced back into the environment.  A typical Tree Service working every day will go through approximately 1 Gallon of chain oil per week: this adds up to over 50 Gallons of petroleum based oil dumped into the environment every year.  At TREECO, we run vegetable based oil as a chain lubricant in all our saws.
