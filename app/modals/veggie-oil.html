What this means:  All of the oil that is poured into a chainsaw as chain lubricant is introduced back into the environment.   A typical Tree Service working everyday will go through approximately 1 Gallon of chain oil per week: this adds up to over 50 Gallons of petroleum based Oil dumped into the environment every year.   Using vegetable based oil in our saws, we are hopefully at the forefront of a trend that will one day become an industry standard.
