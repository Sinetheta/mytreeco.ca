    <h2>Pruning</h2>
    As Certified Arborists we can determine what type of pruning is necessary to maintain or improve the health, appearance, and safety of all trees.<br>

    <strong>Structural:</strong> Trains trees to grow in a specific manner.  Generally improves the strength and longevity of a tree<br>
    <strong>Crown Reduction:</strong> Can drastically increase the amount of sunlight in an area<br>
    <strong>Crown Raising:</strong> Removes lower branches to improve view, provide clearance for buildings, etc<br>
    <strong>Dead-Wood Removal:</strong> Improves general health of the tree.<br>
    <strong>Wind Firming:</strong> Selectively removing branches to increase airflow through the crown.  Decreases the potential for the tree to be blown over during storms.<br>
